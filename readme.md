# Lowest Common Subsequence

This is an implementation of an algorithm to solve the [longest common subsequence problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem) in Javascript.

## Install

`npm install erictrinh/lcs`

## Usage

```javascript
var LCS = require('lcs');

var lcs = new LCS('abc', 'acd');

// length of the longest common subsequence
lcs.getLength(); // 2

// get the longest common subsequences (there may be more than one)
lcs.getSequences(); // [ 'ac' ]

// get the table generated by the algorithm
// see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem
lcs.getTable();
```
